Rudder is a meant to provide a framework to help make it easier
to apply machine learning techniques to your data.

The first few iterations will be mostly utility based in order to 
provide ways to massage a dataset into a set of data that can 
then have statistical analysis performed on it.

Everything in this framework should be thread safe, if you find something
that is not, please post an issue, a patch, or a unit test illustrating
the issue.
